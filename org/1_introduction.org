- Web-based online application (HTML5), no desktop app though you can
  (and should) download it from here:
  1) In your browser, go to [[https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases/][github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases]]
  2) Click on "Source code (zip)" for instant download
  3) In your browser (or on your PC) navigate to ~Downloads~
  4) ~Extract all~ files to any location (~Downloads~ is OK)
  5) Go to the Snap directory, open it and click on ~snap.html~ to start
  6) Close the editor again, and enter ~Snap~ in the Windows search bar
  7) Pin the Snap! app to the taskbar for later use.
     
- Comparison between Snap! and Scratch ([[https://snap.berkeley.edu/about][About Snap!]]):
  + Snap! allows the user to define *data structures* like trees, heaps,
    hash tables etc. because you can define a "list of lists".
  + In Snap!, you can also create *control structures* like functions
    that allow you to automate things.
  + Data and control structures are the backbone of any form of
    *imperative* computer programming.

- This enables you to do things you cannot do in Scratch, including
  anything other high-level languages like C++ or Python can do

* Programming
#+attr_latex: :width 400px

- This could be your first ever programming course. Is it?
  #+begin_quote Survey
  + What were your other courses about?
  + What did you take away from them?
  + What's your view towards programming?
  #+end_quote

- Why should you bother to learn how to program?
  #+begin_quote Answer:
  + Understand the relationships of humans and machines
  + Develop critical thinking skills
  + Create games and animations
  #+end_quote

- The diagram shows different relevant levels of programming and
  computing including hardware (bottom half) and software (top
  half). In this course, we're working on /"Applications"/ that use the
  computer to solve problems. Languages other than /Snap!/ on this level
  include /C++/, /Java/, and /Python/ (all of these are OOP languages
  #+attr_latex: :width 500px
  #+caption: levels of computing (Source: Steinhart, 2019).
  [[../img/1_steinhart.png]]

- The top level "Users" refers to most people who only use computers
  (mostly when operating their smart phones, or driving their
  cars). As with phones or cars, most of the power is under the hood.

- I recommend maintaining a (digital) notebook for this course. That's
  exactly what I did when working through the textbook, using
  [[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs]]. (Talk to me if you want to know more about Emacs.)

* Why Snap!
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Donkey Kong and Pacman arcade games in Snap!
[[../img/stemdemo_arcade.png]]

- It's a full-fledged programming language
- It's easy to build animation and games in it
- It's instantly, freely available online
- It trains pseudocode and modular design
- It's suited for data science applications
- I've always wanted to get into it
  
* Next: looping, broadcasting, animation

- [ ] Snap user interface (UI)
- [ ] Paint editor
- [ ] Sequence of commands
- [ ] Motion commands
- [ ] Simple looping (repeat, forever)
- [ ] Absolute motion
- [ ] Relative motion
- [ ] Smooth motion using repeat
- [ ] Nested looping
- [ ] XY geometry
- [ ] Costume-based animation

* What is a User Interface?
#+attr_latex: :width 400px

[[../img/ui.jpg]]

- A /user interface/ (UI) is the dashboard or platform that allows a
  user to interact with an application. It's the first thing that you,
  as a user, see.

- UI/UX is an important, relatively new, interdisciplinary field that
  includes art and design, usability analysis, etc. UX focuses on the
  user's path to solving a problem (like shopping online), while UI
  focuses on the look of the surface of an interactive product (like a
  web site for online shopping). More: [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-user-reseach-to-create-the-perfect-ui-design/][freecodecamp.org video course]].

* Snap! user interface

- Connect to /snap.berkeley.edu/ and register using your name and Lyon
  student email address.

- For offline use - on any computer that you can administer,
  i.e. where you can download and install programs as you please -
  download the [[https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases/tag/v7.3.1][source files from GitHub]], unpack the files, and open
  ~snap.html~ in a browser.

- This is how the interface looks like:
  #+attr_latex: :width 500px
  #+caption: Snap! user interface (Source: Joshi, 2018)
  [[../img/snap_ui.png]]

- The interface is reminiscent of a movie maker's studio: /commands/ are
  assembled in the /script/ area, and the resulting action plays out on
  a /stage/ with a cast of characters called /sprites/. Every sprite has a
  script associated with it.

- Compare with Windows Movie Maker - commands on the left, script in
  the lower half of the screen, sprites/characters in the middle, and
  stage on the right hand side.
  #+attr_latex: :width 500px
  #+caption: Windows Movie Maker
  [[../img/snap_moviemaker.jpg]]

- As a programmer, you are writing the script for each sprite,
  including movements, sounds, and costumes, but you are also the
  producer, casting director, and editor.
