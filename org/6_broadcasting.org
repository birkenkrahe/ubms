* Synchronize sprites with broadcasting

- Two sprites are not automatically synchronized

- We can synchronize manually or rely on /broadcasting/

- Broadcasting = sending message to a listener

- This is also the basis of OOP [Object Oriented Programming]

- Snap! broadcasting commands:

* Example: greeting
  #+attr_html: :width 400px
  [[../img/hellohello.png]]

- ~Sprite_1~:
  #+attr_html: :width 120px
  [[../img/broadcasthello.png]]

- ~Sprite_2~:
  #+attr_html: :width 120px

- Here is a more elaborate [[https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=birkenkrahe&projectname=broadcasting_fruit][example program]]:

* Practice broadcasting

- Turn the conversation between Alonzo and the Robot into a
  broadcast/receive script. 
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: A conversation between two characters

- Open this project to get the original script: [[https://bit.ly/greenFlag][bit.ly/greenFlag]]

- Duplicate the whole script for each sprite before changing it

* Program 4: Circus

- Write a "circus" program in which the ringmaster calls animals (like
  an elephant) or actors (like a clown) one by one and each performs
  some act. Use at least one animal and one actor, and a suitable
  background.

- The dinosaur should be hidden at the start and appear upon being called.

- The dinosaur should hide when the performance is over.
