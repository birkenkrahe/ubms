- What is a robot?
  #+begin_quote
  [[../img/finch_robot.png]]
  - The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in
    a 1920 Czech-language play [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R.][R.U.R.]] (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti –
    Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek ("The new Adam and Eve")

  - Technically, a robot is a non-virtual "rational agent".
  #+end_quote

- As "Artificial Intelligence", robots are "rational agents":

  1) Upper left: machines that act like humans ("Turing test")
  2) Lower left: machines that think like humans (Neural nets)
  3) Upper right: machines that act rationally (unlike humans)
  4) Lower right: machines that think rationally (not emotionally) -
     the robot arrives at conclusions after computing them.

- How does it work with the Finch?
  [[../img/finch_robot1.png]]
  1) "Sense": Finch sensors at the front
  2) "Think": Microbit controls actions
  3) "Act": LEDs, motors, buzzer, moves, draw etc.

* Setting the Finch robot 2.0 up with Snap!

- Microbit input: sensor data (light, acceleration, temperature,
  magnetism, sound) - see [[https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/overview/][user guide]].
  [[../img/microbit.png]]

- Install the micro:bit by sliding it into the tail of the Finch and
  make sure it is charged:

- [[https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/snap/][There are many programming activities available:]]
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_windows_snap.png]]

- With [[https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/downloads/installers/BlueBirdConnector.msi][Bluebird Connection Web app]] or [[https://snap.birdbraintechnologies.com/][Snap! Web app]]:
  1) Switch on your (charged) robot (black button at bottom).
  2) Click on ~Finding robots~ on the web page.
  3) Your robot should be listed - only connect to yours!
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_find_robots.png]]

- The BlueBird Connector App always finds robots by name, too:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_connect1.png]]
  [[../img/finch_connect2.png]]

- Installation details (completed for classroom use):
  1) Full charge lasts ca. 8 hrs and takes 8 hrs to charge. Green
     lights when turning it on indicate the charging state (4 lights =
     full).
  2) Update the firmware with a ~.hex~ file for the micro:bit every 6
     months or so (get the file [[https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/downloads/installers/BBTFirmware.hex][from here]]).
  3) Once uploaded, the micro:bit responds directly by giving three
     letters (DAT - "Deluxe Apricot Tyrannosaurus") followed by
     pound # sign and its number, e.g. FNC3929.

- Try moving the Finch after connecting to it:
  [[../img/finch_move.png]]

- Overview: [[https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/snap/program/1-14][14 additional programming videos]].

* Moving and turning
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/finch_angles.png]]

- Move forward 10 cm at 25% full speed, then backward by 20 cm at full
  speed:
  [[../img/finch_moving.png]]

- Turn right by 20 degrees at 50% full speed, then left by 90 degrees
  at 75% full speed:
  [[../img/finch_turning.png]]

- Repeat the turning motion 5 times:
  [[../img/finch_repeat.png]]

- Practice:
  1) Make the Finch move in a square, then play a sound.
  2) Put this program into a ~Motion~ block ~Finch square~.

* Controlling wheels
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Muriel Long with bicycle decorated for street procession.
[[../img/wheels.jpg]]

- For a counter-clockwise spinning motion, make the left wheel go
  backward and the right wheel go forward:
  [[../img/finch_spin_left.png]]

- For a clockwise spinning motion, make the right wheel go backward
  and the left wheel go forward:
  [[../img/finch_spin_right.png]]

- To stop, use the "Finch Stop" block or the red STOP editor button:
  [[../img/finch_wait_spin.png]]

- To make the Finch move around in a circle, make the wheels go at
  different speeds while moving forward:
  [[../img/finch_circle.png]]

* Finch movement activities

- Activity idea: finch jousting - known the ball off a cup using
  e.g. a fork on a straw:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_jousting.png]]

- For more intricate movements with the wheels, you need 
  
* Drawing shapes with the pen mount

- Draw a right triangle (use Pythagoras to compute the length of the
  hypothenuse):
  [[../img/finch_right_triangle.png]]

- Drawing shapes activity:
  1) decomposition (drawing the triangle step by step)
  2) evaluation (testing to see if you got what you wanted)

* Drawing a spiral ([[https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch1/activities/finch-spirals/][project]])

1) When the Finch's two motors move at the same speed, it moves in a
   straight line. When they move at different speeds, it moves in a
   circle. The following script works more or less - not quite sure
   about the ~speed~ values - but it produces a spiral.
   #+begin_quote
   #+attr_html: :width 200px
   [[../img/finch_spiral1.jpg]] [[../img/finch_spiral_code1.png]]
   #+end_quote
   
3) An alternative is to use the move + turn commands - this script
   draws a spiral for the turtle:
   #+begin_quote
   #+attr_html: :width 210px
   [[../img/finch_spiral_turtle.png]] [[../img/finch_spiral_turtle_code.png]]
   #+end_quote

4) This will produce a spiral:

* Finch LEDs 
#+attr_latex: :width 200px
[[../img/finch_rgb.png]]

- Red, blue and green are the primary colors of (white) light.

- Turning the Finch's beak red, green then blue forever:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_rgb_forever.png]]

- Why do blue and green make yellow?
  #+begin_quote
  The combination of red and green to make yellow can be explained in
  the context of additive color mixing, which is the way colors of
  light combine. This is the method used by digital displays like
  computer monitors, televisions, and projector screens.

  In the additive color model, the primary colors are red, green, and
  blue. When red light and green light combine, they create yellow
  light. This may seem counterintuitive if you're used to the
  subtractive color model (like mixing paints), where red and yellow
  make orange.

  The reason this happens has to do with how our eyes perceive
  color. We have three types of color receptors, or cones, in our eyes
  that are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), and long (red)
  wavelengths of light. When we see yellow, it's usually because an
  object is reflecting both red and green light to our eyes,
  stimulating both the long and medium wavelength cones. Our brains
  interpret this combination as the color yellow.

  So, when a screen wants to create the perception of yellow, it emits
  both red and green light. Our eyes see this combination of red and
  green light, and our brain interprets it as yellow.
  #+end_quote

- Create an LED disco effect ([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ktyLvQTbW9WwVLbVJkrksWgp6yOqHJc3/view?usp=sharing][see video]]): make LEDs 1,2,3,4 (from the
  right)

- Solution code:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_led_disco.png]]

- You get white light by mixing all colors with the same weight - the
  lower the number the fainter the light: try setting it to 1%
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_led_white.png]]

- How does a prism work?
  #+begin_quote
  As sunlight (white light) enters a prism, its components travel with
  different speeds (wavelengths) leading to refraction - as it exits,
  it is dispersed - cp. Snell's law, which describes the relationship
  between the angles of incidence and refraction for light or other
  waves passing between two different isotropic media (e.g. water,
  glass, air where no direction is privileged over another).
  #+end_quote

- Challenge:
  1) Make every LED in tail and beak show a different color
  2) Turn all LED's white at the same time
  3) Make them blink off/on three times before turning all of them
     off.

- Solution code:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_led_challenge.png]]

- Or with a "blink N times" Finch block:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/finch_led_challenge_block.png]] [[../img/finch_blink.png]]

- Activity: "Finch parade" - turn a Finch in a parade float using
  Lego bricks, blinking lights and movement mixes.

- Computational thinking:
  1) algorithm = order of things
  2) decomposition = parallel blocks
  3) evaluation = match goal to result

- Different setup
- Different course (must register)

* TODO Play with the Finch robot remotely
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/remoteFinch.png]]

- I will set up a server for remote Finch manipulation ([[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPF7p1VM8NT8tcvIG18ALU5skugQ2W7C0][see here]]).

- Let me know if you want to test that for me in July/August.

- Instead of spending 150$ on a Finch + micro:bit you get to use the
  robot for free at a distance and also learn client/server computing.

- There is no guarantee that this will succeed (depends on local
  infrastructure/firewalls) but I'll give it a try.

- This is how it looks ([[https://youtu.be/5YMJP7RhJCk?t=1140][Finch Robot 2.0 Playground - 11/30/20]]).
