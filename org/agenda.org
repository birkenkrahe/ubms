- Agenda overview - what I had planned and what we achieved in each
  session of the course.

- If we don't manage to finish a topic in one session, it'll be
  finished in the subsequent session(s) without change of the
  originally date.

- See the course syllabus for a detailed (tentative) schedule.

- Your *interests* included: engineering (incl. aerospace, software),
  CAD/CAM, art history, fiction writing, video game design, baseball,
  forensic science, and more.
- To avoid *negative* experiences: keep up (don't fall behind), be bold
  (don't be shy), stay calm (don't panic), keep things interesting
  (don't get bored).
- Sometimes, however, "falling behind" can be an important learning
  (it was for me when, at your age, I was too full of myself).
- *Words* included: paradox, JavaScript, black hole, game design, Italy.
- My background: [[https://www.nature.com/subjects/theoretical-particle-physics#:~:text=Theoretical%20particle%20physics%20is%20the,prevailing%20theory%3A%20the%20standard%20model.][theoretical particle physics]] (à la Sheldon
  Cooper). For some of my own publications, see researchgate.net.

  ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe][Wikipedia]]).
- [[https://xkcd.com][xkcd]]: daily cartoons for nerds, "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm,
  math, and language."
- *Research:* use IMRaD (Introduction = what're you investigating?,
  Method = how did you do it?, Results = what did you find out, and
  Discussion = what does it mean? with limitations).
- *Read* stuff at different levels: from shallow to deep.
- *[[https://arxiv.org][arxiv.org]]* - preprint server for scientific papers at Cornell U.

- *SCQA* = Situation (what you already know) + Complication (what you
  don't know) + Question (what you want to know) + Answer
- *Scrum* (term comes from Rugby) - an agile project management method
  to split a project into different periods each closed by a 'sprint
  review' where the team discusses progress with the customer.
- AI assistance (e.g. ChatGPT): yes, as long as you use it for
  drafting, reference it, and don't believe everything it says.
  #+attr_html: :width 400px

- *Plagiarism* is when you use someone else's intellectual capital
  (his/her thoughts, writings, images, code etc.) without giving
  credit (through direct reference).

** Quiz 1 and quiz 2 results visualized

- Put test results in a vector and print histogram and boxplot next to
  one another: for quiz 1
  #+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/q1.png
    q1 <- c(7.25,7.25,8.00,8.25,8.25,8.50,8.50,8.50,9.00,9.25,9.25,9.50)

    par(mfrow=c(1,2),pty='s')
    hist(q1,main="",xlab="Points")
    title("Histogram Quiz 1 results")
    boxplot(q1,horizontal=TRUE,xlab="Points")
    title("Boxplot Quiz 1 results")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/q1.png]]

- And for quiz 2:
  #+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/q2.png
    q2 <- c(2.00,4.25,4.50,5.75,5.75,6.00,6.50,6.75,7.25,7.50,8.50)

    par(mfrow=c(1,2),pty='s')
    hist(q2,main="",xlab="Points")
    title("Histogram Quiz 2 results")
    boxplot(q2,horizontal=TRUE,xlab="Points")
    title("Boxplot Quiz 2 results")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/q2.png]]

- Compare the Quiz 1,2 results using the two boxplots (scales aligned):
  #+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/q1q2.png
    par(mfrow=c(2,1))
    lim = c(min(q1,q2),max(q1,q2))
    boxplot(q1,horizontal=TRUE,xlab="", col="green",
            ylim=lim)
    title("Quiz 1 results")
    boxplot(q2,horizontal=TRUE,xlab="Points", col = "red",
            ylim=lim)
    title("Quiz 2 results")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

- Computers required exact syntactically correct sequences of
  instructions to work at all.
- A typical animation sequence includes at least code from: MOTION
  (sprite movement), CONTROL (program flow), and LOOKS (appearance and
  messages).
- You can upload sounds from the web (as long as the copyright permits
  it), or from the Snap! cloud platform, or record your own directly
  in the editor.
- Some commands will have to complete an action until the script can
  continue, others will cause an action and simply continue even if
  the action is not completed.
- BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) is a process model
  language to create model diagrams (like blueprints).
- You can use BPMN to chart the flow of Snap! scripts.
  
* Loops and costumes (June-16)
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/loop.jpg]]

** [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1721/assignments/14953/edit?quiz_lti][Quiz 3 - sequence and sounds]] (9:30-9:45 hrs)

- Quiz is open book: all resources, online or offline are allowed

- The students with the best results used most of the time

- The students who stayed below 5 minutes got below 50%

** Quiz 2 review

1) "Snap" is actually also a term from the Linux world
   
2) What is 'exception handling'?
   #+begin_quote
   - If the user does something that leads to a wrong input - wrong in
     the sense that the program reacts with an error. Such an
     'exception' - e.g. entering a NAME when a NUMBER is required - is
     handled if the program is prepared for it.
   - Slow apps on your phone or inability to find something online is
     not relevant: exception handling is something the coder does to
     the code.
   #+end_quote

** Review (program submissions)

- Most programs were okay, very few were perfect. Gotta make sure when
  you submit the URL to your online project that the program works
  (e.g. when the sprite doesn't show then it won't work). Missing out
  on parts of the requirements list cost you points - just like in life!

- There should be enough time to complete these in class. Let me know
  if not then I'll make the necessary changes.

- What you don't want in programming (or anywhere else): lose touch
  with the material at the start when it's still easy. Smart students
  start strong and finish strong, and can take it easier in the
  middle.

** Research essay topics

- A couple of people asked for special topics: as long as you come up
  with a good, suitable research question, I'm OK.
  
- Put the question that you want to investigate [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1721/pages/put-your-research-essay-topic-here][in this table]] in
  'Pages' in Canvas, together with your name and any comments you may
  have.
  
- Any other research talk: let's have a conversation in the Snap!Chat.

- Remember that good research questions are very, very
  specific. E.g. "What is the impact of AI on the world?" is not
  doable, but "What is the impact of AI on the computer science
  education in a high school in North Eastern Arkansas? is doable and
  specific enough to be investigated with pleasure and chance of
  success.

** [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ubms/blob/main/org/4_looping_costumes.org][Today: controlling animation - looping and rotation]]
** Summary
- Object orientation is about classes and methods (things the classes
  can do, but also about exchanging messages between objects (the
  ability to send and receive a message is a method, too).
- In Snap!, this will be mimicked by the ~broadcast~ and ~receive~ commands
- In BPMN you can model processes for different participants with
  pools and/or lanes and with sequence or message flow
- You can make sprites do repetitive actions with looping and gliding
  motions. You can create the illusion of smooth motions by combining
  ~repeat~ and motion commands.
- You can alter rotation style when a sprite hits an edge of the
  stage. This is a setting for every sprite (in the menu at the top).

** TODO Post your essay topic to the Snap!Chat now!

The Canvas page approach apparently did not work...
[[../img/page.png]]

** TODO Review - last week:

1) What is a model and why do we make models?
   #+begin_quote
   - Models are abstractions = taking details away systematically
   - Process models or flow charts are examples: e.g. the BPMN model
     of the Alonzo-Space Ranger conversation does not contain the
     waiting times between the statements or visual details.
   - Mathematical models are the most important models that we have,
     e.g. F[orce] = m[ass] * a[cceleration]. Which abstractions are
     involved here?
   #+end_quote
2) Is a Snap! script - e.g. showing a rotating tomato - a model?
   #+begin_quote
   - A Snap! script is based on a model, an abstraction of the real
     world (digital image of a tomato).
   - A Snap! script can also be considered a model on its own, since
     the code for 'motion' or 'looks' or 'sensing' only represents a
     reduced version of real motion, appearance or sensing.
   - You can combine mathematical models and scripting, e.g. by
     implementing physics: [[https://bit.ly/newtonSnap][bit.ly/newtonSnap]] 
   #+end_quote
   #+attr_latex: :width 300px
   [[../img/newton.png]]
3) What is the 'if on edge, bounce' effect? Where is it?
   #+begin_quote
   - Refers to the behavior of the sprite at the border.
   - If the effect is not set, the sprite will continue indefinitely.
   - If the effect is set, one of three rotation styles is active.
   #+end_quote
