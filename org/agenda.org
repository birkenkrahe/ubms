- Agenda overview - what I had planned and what we achieved in each
  session of the course.

- If we don't manage to finish a topic in one session, it'll be
  finished in the subsequent session(s) without change of the
  originally date.

- See the course syllabus for a detailed (tentative) schedule.

* Welcome & orientation (June-12)

- Your *interests* included: engineering (incl. aerospace, software),
  CAD/CAM, art history, fiction writing, video game design, baseball,
  forensic science, and more.
- To avoid *negative* experiences: keep up (don't fall behind), be bold
  (don't be shy), stay calm (don't panic), keep things interesting
  (don't get bored).
- Sometimes, however, "falling behind" can be an important learning
  (it was for me when, at your age, I was too full of myself).
- *Words* included: paradox, JavaScript, black hole, game design, Italy.
- My background: [[https://www.nature.com/subjects/theoretical-particle-physics#:~:text=Theoretical%20particle%20physics%20is%20the,prevailing%20theory%3A%20the%20standard%20model.][theoretical particle physics]] (à la Sheldon
  Cooper). For some of my own publications, see researchgate.net.
- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: famous German writer and polymath
  ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe][Wikipedia]]).
- [[https://xkcd.com][xkcd]]: daily cartoons for nerds, "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm,
  math, and language."
- *Research:* use IMRaD (Introduction = what're you investigating?,
  Method = how did you do it?, Results = what did you find out, and
  Discussion = what does it mean? with limitations).
- *Read* stuff at different levels: from shallow to deep.
- *[[https://arxiv.org][arxiv.org]]* - preprint server for scientific papers at Cornell U.
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/arxiv.png]]
- *SCQA* = Situation (what you already know) + Complication (what you
  don't know) + Question (what you want to know) + Answer
- *Scrum* (term comes from Rugby) - an agile project management method
  to split a project into different periods each closed by a 'sprint
  review' where the team discusses progress with the customer.
- AI assistance (e.g. ChatGPT): yes, as long as you use it for
  drafting, reference it, and don't believe everything it says.
  #+attr_html: :width 400px
  [[../img/batman_robin.png]]

- *Plagiarism* is when you use someone else's intellectual capital
  (his/her thoughts, writings, images, code etc.) without giving
  credit (through direct reference).
- Earliest chatbot (1966): ELIZA, the digital therapist ([[https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html][try it here]]).

** Quiz 1 is available in Canvas - complete it now!
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/quiz.png]]

- There will be occasional quizzes to test your understanding.

- While there's no grade, I'll use the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ubms/blob/main/org/syllabus.org][syllabus criteria]] to assess
  your performance.

- You can check it yourself in the [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1721/grades][gradebook in Canvas]] at any time.

** Leftovers

- You can check out the summary for yesterday's topics in this file
  (also in GitHub - go there now: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ubms][github.com/birkenkrahe/ubms]])
- Check out the Google Snap!Chat for interesting things - go there now
  (sidebar in Lyon Google Mail)!

** Today's lecture: introduction to Snap!
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/lecture.jpg]]

- I lecture while you open the Snap! editor/browser
- You code along at your leisure or at my behest
- The session always closes with a practice session
- Sometimes we'll code a programming assignment in class
- Anything you don't get done you can finish on your own time

- Quiz 1, testing retention of yesterday's class content
- Syllabus: quizzes, gradebook, tentative schedule
- Snap! vs. Scratch (recursive functions, data structures)
- Where do data come from? IoT (Internet of Things)
- Ranking of Programming Languages: [[https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/][TIOBE Index]]
- "The Importance Of Being Earnest" - Victorian play by Oscar Wilde
- How many programming languages are there? (ca. 250 in use, more than
  8,000 known/listed at [[https://hopl.info/][HOPL]]
- Snap! interface, downloading and installing desktop app
- Snap! online, cellular automata and time machine demo
- Punch cards, FORTRAN, importance and limits of programming skills
- Critical thinking skills, what they mean and when they're useful

From the Snap!Chat (Google Space accessible via your Lyon GMail):
- See here for a free ebook on Conway's Game of Life and the cellular
  automata behind it: Johnston/Greene (2022):
  https://conwaylife.com/book/. Cellular automata have many
  interesting applications: fluid dynamics simulations in physics,
  plant growth processes in biology, pseudo random number generation
  in cryptography, traffic flow modeling, city growth patterns in
  urban planning, spread of forest fires in ecology, chemical reaction
  models in chemistry, terrain generation in game development, etc.
- It's time for you to find out what Germans are really like:

** Snap! app in the browser/on the desktop

- To add Snap! as a browser shortcut (only for online Snap!):
  1) open snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html in Google Chrome
  2) click on the three dots in the upper right corner
  3) select ~More tools~
  4) select ~Create shortcut~
  5) name the shortcut ~Snap!~ and check the ~Open as window~ box
  6) click ~Create~ - this will add a shortcut to desktop and Start Menu
- You can also add the local copy of ~Snap!~ but you have to do this manually via the File Explorer.
