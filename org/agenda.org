- Agenda overview - what I had planned and what we achieved in each
  session of the course.

  finished in the subsequent session(s) without change of the
  originally date.

- See the course syllabus for a detailed (tentative) schedule.

- Your *interests* included: engineering (incl. aerospace, software),
  CAD/CAM, art history, fiction writing, video game design, baseball.
- To avoid *negative* experiences: keep up (don't fall behind), be bold
  (don't be shy), stay calm (don't panic), keep things interesting
  (don't get bored).
- Sometimes, however, "falling behind" can be an important learning
  (it was for me when, at your age, I was too full of myself).
- *Words* included: paradox, JavaScript, black hole, game design, Italy.
- My background: [[https://www.nature.com/subjects/theoretical-particle-physics#:~:text=Theoretical%20particle%20physics%20is%20the,prevailing%20theory%3A%20the%20standard%20model.][theoretical particle physics]] (Ã  la Sheldon Cooper).
- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: famous German writer and polymath
  ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe][Wikipedia]]).
- [[https://xkcd.com][xkcd]]: daily cartoons for nerds, "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm,
  math, and language."
- *Research:* use IMRaD (Introduction = what're you investigating?,
  Method = how did you do it?, Results = what did you find out, and
  Discussion = what does it mean? with limitations).
- *Read* stuff at different levels: from shallow to deep.
- *[[https://arxiv.org][arxiv.org]]* - preprint server for scientific papers at Cornell U.

- *SCQA* = Situation (what you already know) + Complication (what you
  don't know) + Question (what you want to know) + Answer
- *Scrum* (term comes from Rugby) - an agile project management method
  to split a project into different periods each closed by a 'sprint
  review' where the team discusses progress with the customer.
- AI assistance (e.g. ChatGPT): yes, as long as you use it for
  drafting, reference it, and don't believe everything it says.
- Earliest chatbot (1966): ELIZA, the digital therapist ([[https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html][try it here]]).
